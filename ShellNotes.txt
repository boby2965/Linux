Shell Scripting
---------------
Kernel:
    A kernel is at the core of the computer. It makes the communication between the hardware and software possible. While the kernel 
    is the innermost part of an operating system, a shell is the outermost part.

Shell:
    A shell is a linux operating system  which takes input from you in the form of commands, processes it, and then gives an output.
    It is  the interface through which a user works on the programs, commands, and scripts. A shell is accessed by a termainal 
    which runs it. (Command Interpeter)
        ex: bash shell, cron shell etc,.

Shell script:
    A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. It is called a shell script 
    because it combines a sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a 
    single script.
        ex: filename.sh 

        Note:
            "sh" command can execute a file even when the file dosen't have a execute perimission.

    $sh Test.sh     --> To execute the sell script 

    echo --> display messages 

    VI Editor:
    ---------
    insert  --> to change to insert mode
    ESC     --> exit from insert mode 
    wq!     --> save & exit 
    r!      --> exit without saving 

    read    --> reads input from the user 

    Arthematic operators:
    --------------------
    +       - Addition
    -       - Subtraction
    \*      - Multiplication
    /       - Division
    %       - Modulo 
    
    If a=20 and b=10 then to add them we use
       `expr $a + $b`

        ` (Ascend) this is to be used 
        ' This is not correct 

    Relational & and Logical Operators 
    --------------------------------
         -gt        - Greater Than              (>)
         -lt        - Less Than                 (<)
         -ge        - Greater then or equal to  (>=)
         -le        - Less than or equral to    (<=)
         -eq        - equal to                  (=)
         -ne        - Not equal to              (!=)

         -a         - And 
         -o         - Or 
         -n         - Not 

    Conditional Statements:
    -----------------------
    simple if 
    if..else..if 
    nested if 

        simple if:
        ---------
            if [condition]
            then 
                STATEMENT 1 
                STATEMENT 2
                -----
            else 
                STATEMENT F 
            fi 

        if..else..if:
        ------------
            if [condition1]
            then 
                Statement 1
                statement 2
            else 
            if [condition2]
            then 
                statement 3
                statement 4
            fi
            fi
        
        Nested if:
        ----------
            if [condition1]
            then 
                Statement 1
                 if [condition1]
                then 
                    Statement 1
                    statement 2
                else
                    statement 4
                fi
            else
                statement 4
            fi

    Test command:
    -------------
    - test command is used with if command 
    - test is used as part of the conditional execution of shell command. 
    - It checks the existance of a file, directory, file perimissions and existance of contents in a file.
    syntax:
        if test -option variable 
        then 
        statement 
        else 
        statement 
        fi 

    option                     usage 
    ------          ------------------------
     -f             ordinary file  then true 
     -d             directory then true 
     -r             readable file then true 
     -w             writable file then true 
     -x             executable file then true
     -s             size is greater than zero then true 

    case statement:
    --------------
        case variable in
        choice 1)
            statement 1 
            statement 2 
        ;; 
        choice 2) 
            statement 3 
            statement 4
        ;; 
        *) 
            statement 5
            statement 6
        esac
